    "For this project, we used a data set called \"[Comcast Customer Complaints](https://www.kaggle.com/archaeocharlie/comcastcomplaints)\", which was uploaded to Kaggle by user Charlie H. The data set consists of CSVs, one containing information about customer complaints to Comcast and another containing information about customer complaints to the FCC about Comcast. Charlie H. scraped the data from consumeraffairs.com and cityexplainer after an overly lengthy support call in order to see if other customers had a similar experience.\n",
